# IT Asset Management Application

## Overview

Welcome to the IT Asset Management Application project! This initiative aims to revolutionize how organizations manage their IT assets, from computers and devices to software licenses and beyond. Our goal is to create a powerful yet intuitive tool that simplifies asset tracking, enhances resource management, and boosts overall operational efficiency. 

## Current Status

As of now, we're actively developing the application. We've completed the frontend, focusing on crafting a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS for styling), and JavaScript. This frontend allows users to view existing assets, add new ones, and manage basic asset details effortlessly.

## Planned Features

### Our roadmap includes some exciting features:

- Comprehensive Asset Tracking: Keep detailed records of each asset's specifications, maintenance history, and location.
- Automated Inventory Management: Implement automated processes for inventory updates, audits, and replenishment.
- Integrated Service Desk: Enable users to log IT service requests directly within the app and track their resolution progress.
- Reporting and Analytics: Generate customizable reports on asset utilization, costs, and compliance.
- User Roles and Permissions: Define different roles (like admin, IT manager, technician) with specific access rights.
- 
## Technologies Used
